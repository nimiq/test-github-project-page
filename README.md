GitHub can host static HTML website, formally named GitHub Pages:  
http://pages.github.com/  
https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles

They run on a subdomain of github.io, but you can also use your own custom domain name.  
There are 2 types of GitHub Pages:
 - **User/Organization** site: related to a user/organization
 - **Project** site: related to a repository

This is an example of project site  
The project itself is empty, but the branch ```gh-pages``` contains the static site

What kind of static content?
----------------------------
Any static HTML content

There's an automatic generator which lets you write content in Markdown:

Or you can simply checkout the gh-pages branch and edit the HTML code

There is also a fancy blog generator tool name [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll):

You could use this to present your project, like this amazing [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentation:
